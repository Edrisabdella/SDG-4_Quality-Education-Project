OpenLearn: Inclusive Peer-to-Peer Digital Education Platform
 
OpenLearn: Inclusive Digital Education Platform
Overview
OpenLearn is a comprehensive digital education initiative designed to directly address UN Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4): Quality Education. Our platform tackles educational inequality by combining peer-to-peer tutoring with a rich digital resource hub, specifically targeting underserved communities and bridging the digital divide.
We recognize that limited access to quality education, digital resources, and academic support creates significant barriers to learning. OpenLearn dismantles these barriers by creating an inclusive ecosystem where students become both learners and educators, fostering a sustainable cycle of knowledge sharing and collaborative growth.
